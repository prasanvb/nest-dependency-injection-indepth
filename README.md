# nestjs-dependency-injection-indepth

- `nest generate module computer` - generates a module with name computer
- `nest generate service cpu` - generates a service with name cpu
  - NOTE: `@Injectable()` decorator is added by default to the service generated by CLI cmd
- `nest generate controller computer` - generates a controller with name computer
  NOTE: If a module name already exists with same name as the service or controller, then the service or controller will be created inside the module.
