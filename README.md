# nestjs-dependency-injection-indepth

- `nest generate module computer` - generates a module with name computer
- `nest generate service cpu` - generates a service with name cpu
  - NOTE: `@Injectable()` decorator is added by default to the service generated by CLI cmd
- `nest generate controller computer` - generates a controller with name computer
  NOTE: If a module name already exists with same name as the service or controller, then the service or controller will be created inside the module.

## Exporting Services

- By default the services of each module are private, until exported services can't be accessed by other module
- Once services are added exports list, other module first needs to import the module, so it can call imported service inside its classes
- To call imported service methods inside a class, define the constructor with the newly imported service. Now imported service methods can be called inside the class methods
